1. In my opinion, the best metric is Root Mean Squared Error because we usually use it in our class.
2. My implementation are in 'data_challenge_01.ipynb', 'data_challenge_01_b.ipynb' and 'data_challenge_01_c.ipynb' files.
   Firstly, I split the train data set to two parts. One part is to train data and the other is to valid the train model.
   Secondly, I use LabelEncoder, get_dummies and their combination to convert text to numeric values.
   Thirdly, I use LinearRegression, StandardScaler, PCA, LASSO, Ridge and GridSearchCV in each file.
   Fourthly, I use matplotlib to draw the original train data and my predicted data to see the difference between them.
   Lastly, I compare all the Root Mean Squared Error from above and select the best to generate the target for the test set. 
3. All best prediction are in 'a.csv', 'b.csv' and 'c.csv'. 
   Since the train model that generates 'c.csv' has the minimum Root Mean Squared Error, my prediction for the target on the test set is in 'c.csv'.
